# employee-tracker

## Description

My motivation was to create a tracking system for employees for organization purposes. I built this project so there could be order to individuals in different departments, roles, etc. This problem solves failed attemps at making changes in a database when updates are necessary. I learned how to use logic to meet the criteria associated with tracking changes.
